## Introduction 🚀
This project involves analyzing a time series dataset to predict future sales. It includes data preparation, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Description 📝
In this project, we aim to train a sales forecasting model using time series data sourced from Kaggle. We'll analyze the dataset, perform necessary data preprocessing, explore patterns and trends, and train a forecasting model to predict future sales.

## Steps 🛠️
1. **Data Preparation**: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, clean the data, and preprocess it.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the data to understand its patterns and trends.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the dataset to improve the model's performance.
4. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate forecasting model based on the data characteristics.
5. **Model Training**: Train the selected model on the data and optimize its hyperparameters.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model for making sales forecasts.

For detailed implementation, refer to the Jupyter Notebook provided.
